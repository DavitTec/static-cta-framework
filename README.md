# Static CTA Framework

> Summary: [Basic project short summary goes here]

A design-system–driven, campaign-aware static site compiler
focused on landing pages, documentation, and feedback-driven design.

## What this is

This project is not a website.
It is a framework for designing, documenting, and compiling
static landing experiences with discipline and traceability.

## Core Principles

- Static by default
- Data-driven content
- Design system first
- Feedback loops over assumptions
- Build artifacts are reviewable

## Directory Overview

- src/ → source of truth
- dist/ → DEV runtime
- stage/ → staged runtime (future)
- build/ → production artifact
- doc/ → design & methodology docs

## Development Modes

MODE is strictly one of:

- DEV
- STAGE
- PROD

MODE never controls content or campaigns.

## Status
